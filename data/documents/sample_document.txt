RAG Chatbot Documentation

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a natural language processing technique that combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. RAG systems first retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and then use that information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Processing: Documents are loaded, preprocessed, and split into chunks
2. Vector Embeddings: Text chunks are converted into vector representations using embedding models
3. Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search
4. Query Processing: User queries are converted into embeddings
5. Retrieval: Similar document chunks are retrieved based on vector similarity
6. Generation: A language model generates responses using the retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Improved accuracy by grounding responses in factual information
- Ability to work with domain-specific knowledge
- Reduced hallucination compared to pure generative models
- Easy to update knowledge base without retraining models

Technical Components:
- Document Processor: Handles loading and chunking of various document formats
- Vector Store: Manages embeddings and similarity search (ChromaDB, FAISS)
- Retriever: Finds relevant documents for a given query
- Language Model: Generates responses based on context (OpenAI GPT, local models)
- Web Interface: Provides user-friendly interaction through Streamlit

Use Cases:
- Customer support chatbots
- Internal knowledge management systems
- Educational Q&A systems
- Document analysis and summarization
- Research assistance tools

This RAG chatbot implementation supports PDF, TXT, and DOCX documents and provides both web and command-line interfaces for interaction.
